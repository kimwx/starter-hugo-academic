abstract: In this paper, we analyze how sequentially introducing decision
  variables into an integer program (IP) affects the value function and its
  level sets. We use a Gilmore-Gomory approach to find parametrized IP value
  functions over a restricted set of variables. We introduce the notion of
  maximal connected subsets of level sets - volumes in which changes to the
  constraint right-hand side have no effect on the value function - and relate
  these structures to IP value functions and optimal solutions.
